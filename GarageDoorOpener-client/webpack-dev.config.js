//From a technical view it makes no sense to use the CommonsChunkPlugin with a single app entry, it only makes it look better.
//It costs an additional HTTP request and doesn't give you anything in production.
//In development however separating vendor to its own bundles provides faster incremental compiling.
//Ref - https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/368
//Note - Karma is not compatible with the commons chunk plugin so it must be disabled for testing.
//Ref - [https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack/issues/24].
//Also we don't wish to bother with minification for development.
